                <h2>About me...</h2>
                <p>According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly.
                    Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground.
                    The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible.<br>
                    Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black.<br>

                <h2>Programing...</h2>
                <p>For me programming is a passion, and one that I dedicate much of my time to.</p>
                <p>While I am still a beginner, I have experience in a variety of languages:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Python</li><li>C#</li><li>C++</li><li>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</li><li>SQL</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If you want to have a look at some of my projects, see <a href="https://github.com/LilSpinachBoy1?tab=repositories">my GitHub profile</a> for more!
                    I have experience in console-based applications, games development (using both Unity and PyGame) and physical design using Raspberry Pi.
                    I truly love the art of programming, and hope to pursue it in the future, potentially even as a career path! It brings me joy and helps me focus my mind on a problem.
                </p>
                <p>Programing is only the start of my obsession with technology; it is an incredible field with so much potential to change the world.
                    Ultimately I believe that technology runs through every aspect of life, and it is a vital tool for helping humanity...<br>
                    All the way from <i>print("Hello World")</i> to life-saving medical treatment!
